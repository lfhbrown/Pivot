Pivot the Virtual Treasurer

This idea came about because a fantasy football league that I've been a part of for ten years lost 6 of it's members due to differences about the league rules. It was looking like I finally would have to find another league to join. That's not exactly hard , the problem is that public leagues aren't cash leagues. Therefore no skin in the game and that's no fun at all. As anyone who plays fantasy for cash knows, it's all about trust. You can have the greatest commissioner in fantasy history but if you're treasurer has a gambling problem or is living paycheck to paycheck, there's a good chance your league doesn't live to see a second year. Imagine not even knowing the people you're playing with?! I started to think there's got to be a solution. I looked online and saw a few options, but they seemed outdated and clunky.

I thought to myself this would be a good idea to build the solution that I was searching for, a virtual treasurer. Something modern, mobile friendly and takes advantage of todays tech. Here is my vision:

1.    A clean UI with the capability to customize your fantasy payouts a myriad of ways
2.    Utilize cutting edge technology by integrating Web 3.0 capabilities and taking advantage of crypto wallets, and the power of the ledger.
3.    API calls to the most popular fantasy platforms to port over the league standings which will feed into our logic that controls payouts to fantasy ownerâ€™s crypto wallets at the end of the season
